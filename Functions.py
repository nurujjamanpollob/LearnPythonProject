    This topic introduces about python functions,
    functions means a useful set of code block to divide your code
    and accomplish and organize your code and goal.

    Now, I am going to write some functions, to show you some example.

# Create a simple function
def simple_function_print_greeting():

# This function used to take a String input from the end user
# Function with return statement, the return statement is used to return object when a method execution process
# is finished

simple_function_print_greeting()

# This print statement take input from user using a custom function and print it
print("The input from user -> %s \n\n" % take_input_from_user())

"""
    So you see, using functions, we can organize our code and do different task to 
    accomplish a bigger task.
    
    Let's create function with arguments, the process flow consist two user input,
    then merge those two input in a string, and print it
