"""
    Python conditions.

    Python usages boolean expression to evaluate a condition.
    A True or False is returned when an expression is being compared or evaluated.

    This section also going to cover logical and comparison operator usages, and their functions.
"""

# In this example, we are going to use comparison equal '==' operator
# To evaluate a simple condition

# Create a simple condition (if / else)
# It should execute else statement
if 1 == 2:

else:
    print(" 1 is not equals 2")

# Create a simple condition (if / else)
# It should execute if statement

if 1 == 1:

    print("1 equals 1")

else:
    print(" 1 is not equals 1")

# Create a condition (if/elif/else) to evaluate an expression
# This example going to cover usages of comparison grater than '>' operator
# It should execute elif statement
# create a simple variable

    print("Executed if statement")

elif 11 > varX:

# This example is going to coverage simple
# if statement with usages of comparison '<' less than operator

# In this example, is going to cover a simple if statement with usages of

# This example going to cover logical operator 'and' to evaluate two or more than two
# Boolean expression, if all expression matches true, it should return true, otherwise false
# This example is going to evaluate an if statement, which all sub-condition evaluate true.

# This example going to cover logical operator 'or' to evaluate two or more than two

# is false, it returns false
# This example is going to evaluate an if statement, it has three condition, one statement is true only
# So it should return true

# This example going to cover logical 'not' operator
# which simply used to negate a condition, for example, an expression 5 > 4 is True
# using 'not' treated it as False
# This example is going to execute a false statement, which will not execute, if you remove 'not' operator
